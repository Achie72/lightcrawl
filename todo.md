- MVP STUFF
- add f5 and ctrl f5 with shortcut

- Add actual button listener
- Balance spawns
- Add legendary items to shops
- add at least slimes back


- SFX

- Animations
- Particles


- Good to have

- Text floats (non mvp)
- Smoother movement (non mvp)
- Enemy vareity (??? very much not MVP feature)
- sprite outlines?
- CHECK WHAT does in gmatch()

- Any button vs designated control button
- Look into touchscreen controls with love.js (!!!!) (not MVP, good to have)
  - Figure out how to detect "touch" vs "hold"
  - Code almost works, but seems to ignore the hold effect

- Figure out if movement is gonna be speed based (so objects always move with speed X) OR we are doing steps which is always 1 pixel, but control how fast steps follow each other

- CONSIDER REPLACING ITEMS WITH BUFFS

- make it so that negative choice cannot be greater than your current value (???)
  - could apply to only health maybe????

- fix gameover logo being even so no middle align

- Create pickups (potions, whetstones, hammers) (DONE)
- Create buffs (+1hp, +1durability etc...) for example (-2 hp/+5 shield) (+5 hp/-2 damage) (DONE)
- make it so that a choice is always a choice, aka if you have 0 in a stat, do not roll said stat for a choice item. (DONE)
- Gameover
